# ibrandsActions

This is mi response to the test sent by Paula Vandrell as part of the selection process for a Backend Engineer at ibrands.

I decided, instead of creating first 700 "Apertura" objects and then 300 "Click" objects, that they would be created in a random order.

Also, i decided to display all the actions in a table to show that all of them were created correctly.

I put the constants with the maximum instances of each object inside the classes, just ot not create a config.php file, but that could be easily changed.

Everithing else I think that follows the guidelines provided.
